HUD Manager is a simple tool for creating a local HUD mirror. Can be used with the SRC Repair project.

This product can operate in two modes: anonymous and authorized. You will be asked to select mode and enter GitHub API token on the last step of the installation.

HUD Manager support the following methods of storing the API key:
  * launcher (API key will be saved in auto-generated launcher) - default;
  * environment options (API key will be saved in user's environment variables) - will require a system reboot;
  * manual mode - no API keys will be saved, but can be forwarded manually using environment variables.

Personal API key can be generated here: https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line.
